### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

* **mojaloop/#2538:** Forcing a major version change for awareness of the config changes. The `LIB_RESOURCE_VERSIONS` env var is now deprecated, and this is now also controlled by the PROTOCOL_VERSIONS config in the default.json. This has been done for consistency between all API services going forward and unifies the config for both inbound and outbound Protocol API validation/transformation features.
